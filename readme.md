## Let's Make A Menu

This is intended as a basic guide to using HTML, CSS and Javascript to build a menu and basic website. It assumes you know how HTML and CSS work and provides a quick intro on how to use those with javascript to create dynamic HTML pages.

Each lesson is a different branch of this repo. Once the dev build is watching files and running in the browser you can checkout whichever branch you want to look at and the web page will update to reflect the changes.

The readme file for each branch explains what each part of the code is doing for each lesson.  

Use your browser dev tools to inspect menu elements and CSS properties and play with the values and options described in each lesson to see how they alter the menu.

### Running The Examples

This is a webpack project with both a dev and build option.
