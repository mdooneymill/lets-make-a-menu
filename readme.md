## Let's Make A Menu

This is intended as a guide to using HTML, CSS and Javascript to build a menu.  

Each lesson is a different branch of this repo. Once the dev build is watching files and running in the browser you can checkout whichever branch you want to look at and the web page will update to reflect the changes.

The readme file for each branch explains what each part of the code is doing for each lesson.  

Use your browser dev tools to inspect menu elements and CSS properties and play with the values and options described in each lesson to see how they alter the menu.

### Running The Examples

This is a webpack project with both a dev and build option.  
Install required node packages with `npm i`
Run the examples with `npm run dev`  and `npm run build
